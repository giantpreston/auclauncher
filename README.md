A launcher that makes playing the old versions of Among Us even easier! 😁

There are currently no releases of this launcher. 

## Build

## Notes:
*This project does __not__ redistribute .EXE files of the game. It simply checks if the user has the game on Steam and downloads it from a storage device. __We are not pirates!__ 🏴‍☠️*
